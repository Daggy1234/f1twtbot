@RyanMcG92 I think that is an amazing answer. I've no idea if you can calculate that one. But if that's your goal, it would be almost too easy! The amount of construction needed to run an F1 engine is far beyond what cars can produce and that's the reason it's worth funding. I wonder why the market has run much higher than that? - mDV5
