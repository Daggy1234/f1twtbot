====================
FIA president Jean Todt has attacked the referendum and what he believes is the erosion of Europe. He has told the Sofia district that it will be their "natural" choice and that the people "believe in a united Europe" that's why it's called a #remain. I think there is some need for caution because there are many different views. However, it's great to see how much F1 is united. Let's hope we can put it to a vote

F1 responds by reiterating that he did not act in any way to backwash. That's not responding in any way. That's anti-thesis. It's anti-tenure. And there's no actually running a follow-up to that. Sorry. That's just plain wrong

Not a bad stint for the Red Bull to extend its advantage over Mercedes in Japan: 8 points to Hamilton for P1!  I’m amazed we’ve got that many points. But the damage done by this massive crash and loss of power had been devastating.  Red Bull’s drive is pretty impressive! I’m not sure what Alonso and Ocon’s prospects were

@IjY44 Not right up there. And basically, I think that's the point of the argument is I'm not sure if you're going to really think it through. Well actually I think the point is that the fact it's having to read the agreement and the range that's being set out, we see the United States are still paying around 10% of the costs. And obviously that's been approved by the EU. Which of course gives them an unfair advantage but it also looks the risk is set so high. But we should look at it. It's a matter of freedom of movement being very important here. I think we'd all prefer to stay home. But we do have the right to be here as citizens and we are able to do that. And that's it. And it's okay to be in this sport

2017 only gives you one year to plan as many serious F1 cars and Prost having a financial meltdown is a real sign that things are going to get serious. But we all know there will be more than one terrible driver driving under the rules. (The other reason for its difficulty: F1's partnership with Heinz.)

Great thanks to @PitlaneRadio for this excellent guest spot on my latest documentary shorts. If you'd like to support its purchase or make a donation now  
====================
Amusing my family and friends. An eerie night with everyone.  I was like ten years old when these words came.    
But do that. I've got a question. Why won't I be living in Singapore? Have you thought it out? If you can do it for me in time for me.....   
@swtor Worries of 'flood'?

Lunar eclipse on Sydney radio stations to bring everyone to the floor here's what we were talking about:  
====================
I’m so excited to see the result. Thank you guys!!
====================
Relive @dariofranchitti's life in 7️⃣3️⃣ seconds. 🏆 And we see it all from a pair of slippery gloves that Senna wore! 🔥  #ExperienceF1 #BahrainGP 🇧🇭
====================
I really think he was hiding it to let you think it was all downhill from there! A lot of worse things are happening in Londres that'll make it easier to deny the #F1 title?
====================
Okay so I went for the guy that didn't make it into qualifying but it's still time to make good use of my potential...

I don’t want to get lost in this but first it’s important to realise that these headlines just happened yesterday but that’s life and you’ve got to deal with them if you’re in a world like this where everything is fake    #F1

====================
“@Ricciardo: Lots of thoughts about the possibility of more tyre flexibility for next year. So what's the idea with these two to fight for?” - genuinely quite nice. I've got nothing against Mercedes but they definitely have a chequered flag on their hand on season to-days 2014 - they didn’t last long but we're comfortable with it!🤷

In recent years we have seen the gender of both drivers and crew depart from F1 and the participation of Asian men in motorsport. We feel it has become more accepted as a career choice in this day and age. It would be great to see more female F1 drivers as the series continues!  A bid from @alo_oficial (link in Chinese) to foster female F1 racers has failed after the departure of his Indian chauffeur.  (@alo_oficial is a brilliant decision; wish there were a policy that actually funded it.)

Greenspan says if Bernal was told he could get up to 10% less cost it's probably unlikely he would have accepted the offer. But if there were chances to recoup, he certainly would have done so.

====================
<|startoftext|>@DavidChappell True to Bill - the logistics of getting rid of the turbo-diesel and OHV means a V10 doesn't get hot until the last minute during the middle part of the engine. But we've established the sun will get the better bang for the buck. Plus if you do get rid of the turbo engine the fuel saving is great too! Plus this can be tweaked afterwards. Or if you were in the USA or Europe you could swap to a real V10 in the morning

Onboard with Lap 3 of this qualifying session. Back of the car pretty much where I was always sliding. Definitely more to come for the pitstops!

Another great day! That’s it for Germany today 🙌🏼 #PunTailah v @GarrettBeynish for getting @SammyXR-ed a lap around @reservedcorons 🎥 @VTiMMotorsports  
====================
It’s #FP1. We’ve got plenty of work to do 💪 @SChecoPerez has a perfect lap under the lights to top the timesheets. The run is @redbullracing’s best run of the session. #F1
====================
Great let's have a new name 😄 #RussianGP  
====================
Laughter. 😎 It’s a crazy Thursday with ‘Barbarović’  - and this week’s track-action from a crazy year! @WilliamsRacing @TommyHilfiger @carlosainz @Prost_official ...wait for it...

====================
What a massive frustration 💚😬 #MexicanGP
====================
This is phenomenal. So proud of these two
====================
We can do a lot more now that we don’t have to. So we’ve been trialling our own MRB this year. We’ve been trying to get the best out of the car. It’s been an interesting year for me. Now I just need to get back in the car
====================
Lots of people's faces watching that really cool lap.   He's got that speed.   #SaudiArabianGP #F1 #Formula2  
====================
It’s the all-time #F1 record for most @damsonscedoms we ’ve driven

Dear Mom &amp; Dads. Last Night I collapsed and meditated &amp; joined with some of the vegans &amp; Nats &amp; Red Bull drivers as they train &amp; get ready for Paris. So. I'll be doing it every day
====================
Better lap of the FP3 in Hockenheim than it was at the time

@ValenciaFS @EstebanGf1 Yep that's pretty impressive that's the commitment.  And you’ve got an impressive effort too! Thanks. 👍
====================
New year-end (which I'm fairly sure means that the year-end has officially gone by the week). Not the typical @F1 year-end...   #TeamABC
====================
@ace_koushuk 👋
====================
@willsnest @ieaglecoach @ackdavidson We thought you meant @jackclough@15. At least he never had to worry about being removed from contention before the race was stopped @dcf1 #F1

I’m very sure the pegashers are the child. Just threw in a few bottles of the same thing in the shower

   Thank you all for coming.
@mas_tax Thanks. Couldn't ask for more.
@Schumacher26 @SubZeroF1 Many thanks.
@marcus_leclerc Would have liked that much more had a good header
@MenaceF1 @MenaceF1 One of the things I've learned from the last few years is that the cruciate ligament can recover too well
====================
I hate to do this...@chrisfroome’s got a guy...@ValeYellow46: can I stop you too? #F1 #IranGP
====================
Wow! Thanks @JensonButton. That meant so much! Yeah I lost my laptop! Thanks for the journey and everyone involved. 🙏👊
====================
Manifest destiny. Great weekend! Back and more than perfect 😁

More heartbreaking news for the outside Schumacher’s Super Rookie finisher @NickYello. Our sympathy goes out to this great talent as he recovers well at home 👍

In a situation like that
====================
50/50. To be to the end that you can somehow call it a sandwich. There is. Just hasn't got the finish line there. Until the ground closes.
====================
YEWWWW!!!!!!!!! That was a hell of a challenge
====================
We think we saw what happened when @BurtSuppv2 had to go crazy! 🚩 If you missed it
====================
@O_Checo 👋
====================
Alex Albon has a red flag on his 2017 car. They're on the FIA provisional rulebook
====================
Slap for the crew. I know why it took so long to nail that. Nice, fair fight. 👊
====================
My bold predictions for 2017: *Hitting Renault's rear tyre in 2018 or 2019
====================
We have created a new "Whoops" video with @alex_albon
====================
@stelios1 @gmaxwellstowe that was fascinating. I did a little bit of it with a hybrid as a kid. We'll see how things go 📺📺📺
====================
Again late today. The story was this guy was arrested yesterday but according to the twitter sources "legal issues" apparently undeliverable 
====================
Thank you, Joe

====================
Great lap @danielricciardo
====================
What an amazing tribute for a sport icon - a link to a true leader - here we are!  
====================
@Charles_Leclerc This is why the pit walls aren't raised all the way? There have been times when everyone has opted not to bother with such measures. And then the driver who shouldn't have been penalised gets off with a warning.
====================
Everyone: This is incredible! #USGP
====================
Low fuel time

Oh dear!! Definitely not back then... 😳  #HalturaTradition #NorrisVettel @AnguloSpeed @NewToroDevices

Lorraine and Daniel doing a great job out front today. They make each other such good base for third and fourth. Lorraine has power. Lights out at 1800 hrs and P2 in qualifying. Henrique however still on the softs. But using the mediums
====================
“There are plenty of other channels on the W22 and in the interests of fairness I’m going to try that’s in the Ferrari F1 team” – Pirelli is joining us for F1 testing. It’s a lovely channel. Instead of Spotify we’ll have [audioshield] but more relaxing modes...”  It’s some very long, more soothing modes now.

Cruising to my favorite circuit on a wacky and challenging trip. Tomorrow a race that truly suits the style
